### Hi there! I'm Bryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a SWE with a non-traditional path, reach out to me for any questions/advice!

In my free time, I enjoy working out, learning new things, discovering new music, and exploring new places.

I am nearing the completion of my BS in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University!
